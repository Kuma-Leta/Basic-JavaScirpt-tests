Section 1: Loops and Algorithms
This repository contains solutions to two algorithmic problems related to loops: factorial calculation and generating Fibonacci series.

Factorial Calculation
Description
The calculateFactorial function takes a non-negative integer n as input and returns the factorial of n.

Input
n: A non-negative integer.
Output
The factorial of n.

Fibonacci Series
Description
The generateFibonacciSeries function takes an integer num as input and returns an array containing the Fibonacci series up to the numth element.

Input
num: An integer specifying the length of the Fibonacci series.
Output
An array containing the Fibonacci series up to the numth element.

Section 2: Objects

Objects
This repository contains solutions to two tasks related to objects: creating a user profile and representing a book inventory.

User Profile
Description
The userProfile object represents a user's profile with the following properties:

name: The user's name (string).
age: The user's age (number).
email: The user's email address (string).
Book Inventory
Description
The bookInventory object represents a library book inventory with each property representing a book having the following attributes:

title: The title of the book (string).
author: The author of the book (string).
pages: The number of pages in the book (number).
available: A boolean indicating whether the book is available in the library.

Section 3: Dom manipulation

DOM Manipulation
This repository contains solutions to three tasks related to DOM manipulation: toggling visibility, form validation, and dynamic content creation.

Toggle Visibility
Description
Create an HTML file with a button element (id: "toggleButton") and a div element (id: "content"). When the button is clicked, toggle the visibility of the content div.

Form Validation
Description
Create an HTML form with fields for "username" and "password", along with a submit button. Using JavaScript, validate that both fields are filled out when the submit button is clicked.

Dynamic Content Creation
Description
Create an HTML file with an empty div element (id: "dynamicContent"). Using JavaScript, dynamically create and append five paragraph elements to the div, each containing a unique message or text.

Section 4:Error Handling:

Error Handling
This repository contains solutions to two tasks related to error handling: division by zero and JSON parsing error.

Division by Zero
Description
Write a function named divide that takes two parameters a and b and returns the result of dividing a by b. Handle the case where b is 0 gracefully by throwing an appropriate error message.

JSON Parsing
Description
Attempt to parse an invalid JSON string using JSON.parse(). Wrap the parsing code in a try-catch block to handle any errors. If successful, log the parsed object to the console; if an error occurs, log "Error: Invalid JSON string!
